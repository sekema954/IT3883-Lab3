Assignment 3
SUBMIT original code in Python to solve the problem below.  
Please be aware that copying and pasting code from any other source other than code you have explicitly written on your own is considered plagiarism.  If you receive help, that is fine (document help in the comments of your code) however you need to write your own code, name your own variables, and comment your own code. Students turning in the exact same work as another student will all be given zeros. Plagiarism is not tolerated, and students found to be plagiarizing will be given a zero and reported to the University with the possibility of termination of the class and degree program.
For this assignment you will write a GUI application to convert Miles per Gallon into Kilometers per Liter.  

Your GUI should behave like most online conversion tools where the result is updated with each number the user types. The user should not need to click on a button to compute the final total. Your program should also not crash in the event of the user typing a letter or leaving a box blank. 

For conversion: 1 mpg = 0.425143707 km/l

REMEMBER 
	Include the comment heading at the top of your code.
o	# Program Name: Assignment2.py (use the name the program is saved as)
o	# Course: IT3883/Section XXX
o	# Student Name: John Doe
o	# Assignment Number: Lab#
o	# Due Date: xx/xx/ 20XX
o	# Purpose: What does the program do (in a few sentences)?
o	# List Specific resources used to complete the assignment.

	Place comments within your code explaining the programming segments
	Submit the .py file and a screen shot of the output via GitHub.
